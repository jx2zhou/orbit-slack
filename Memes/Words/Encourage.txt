Hey! Keep up the good work.
You can do it! Take it from me, I am the Slackboss.
I see that code you’ve been writing! Nice!
If I were your real boss, I would give you a raise! However, I am Slackboss. You know how it is…

Miley Cyrus once said “If you believe in yourself, anything is possible.” I’m not sure that she was the first person to say that, but she did say it.
If you ever need anything, I’m here for you! Mostly to keep track of time, but I’ve been told I’m a great listener.
You have my full support! Keep going!
I’m proud of you for figuring that thing out. On to the next problem!
Stay positive! You’re doing an awesome job.
