Commence work time! The sky’s the limit, baby.
Looks like it’s time for us to start working. You got this!
Heyyy, remember that thing we were working on? Let’s check it off the list!
The moment you’ve been waiting for: work time!
I hope you’re feeling rested, it’s time to keep going!
The end is in sight! Let’s work.
All right, it’s time to get back to it!
Let’s work! But first, how’s your posture? Feeling ergonomic? Remembering to blink now and then? All right, you got this. 
I hope you had a restful break. Work time is here!
Ready to work? I’m gonna start the timer. Let’s go.
Don’t cry because it’s over, smile because it happened. I’m talking about that break. Let’s put in some work!
Being the Slackboss isn't all fun and fancy titles. I also have to remind you to work.
Work time!!!
